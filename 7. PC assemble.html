								<h2>PC maintenance class</h2>
								<p>At Makmal Inovasi (322-02) N28, Level 3A, there was a PC maintenance class. There were groups made up of my peers. Group 5, with five people, is where I was assigned. For the first semester of the course, SECP1513, the group is also working on a group assignment. Before the assembly began in class, lab assistants gave us a briefing on things like the introduction of PC compartments and how they work. Prior to using the instructions, we were instructed to remove the PC's compartments one at a time while keeping in mind their respective locations. </p>

								<p>We have to replace the compartments that were removed once they were taken out. When everything was done, we had to bring our constructed PC out front for testing to see that it was still functional and to check whether the assembly and positioning of the PC were correct. Initially, our group was unsuccessful as the memory card was positioned incorrectly. On our second try, we succeeded! In order to improve our comprehension of today's session, we were also given a page to name a compartment based on what we learned.</p>

								<h2>My reflection ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧</h2>
								<p>Participating in Makmal Inovasi's PC maintenance course was a hands-on experience. GrouIn addition to being a technical experience, taking the PC maintenance course was an experience of growth—both individually and collectively. The value of cooperation and clear communication was underlined by Group Five's efforts.</p>
								<p>Practical experience disassembling and reassembling PCs taught me important lessons about accuracy and attention to detail. Our group's increased flexibility and problem-solving abilities were demonstrated when we overcame the initial obstacle of positioning the memory card wrong.</p>
								<p>In addition to strengthening my technical abilities, the class,which culminated in the creative naming exercise,also helped me develop resilience and a sense of success. In general, this experience has been very helpful in improving my technical skills as well as my personal qualities such as flexibility and teamwork.</p>
